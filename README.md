OpenGL ES 1.1 pipeline simulator

It's purposed to research tile-based rendering architecture that is suitable for embedded system.
The API standard is based on OpenGL ES 1.1 spec., and the parts of implemenation referenced for 
Vincent ES 1.x (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogl-es/), glues (https://code.google.com/p/glues/), 
GLUT materials (http://user.xmission.com/~nate/opengl.html), and other 3D obj files for free. 
Basically, the back-end of a simulator is divided into geometry and rendering processing. 
Many simulation statistics are generated to analysis the characteristics of graphics output.
